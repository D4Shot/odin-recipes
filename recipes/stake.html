    <em>
      There are very few things in life as beautiful as a glistening, <br />
      smoky flank steak on a grill, <br />being painted with beerbecue sauce.
      Any beer will do, <br />
      but try to use something on the more aggressive side if you can. The
      subtle bitterness <br />
      from the beer in the background really makes this sauce pop.

    <h2>Cooking steps</h2>
    <!--here starts cooking section   -->
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>step</b>
          <br />
          Pour ketchup, molasses, and white vinegar in a bowl; add white sugar,
          2 teaspoons black pepper, 1 teaspoon salt, cayenne pepper, cumin,
          allspice, and cinnamon. Whisk until sauce is smooth. Pour in beer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>step</b>
          <br />
          Place flank steak into a non-reactive container; pour sauce over meat.
          Poke at least 100 holes per side in the flank steak using 2 forks.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>step</b>
          <br />
          Cover container with plastic wrap and marinate beef 8 to 12 hours (up
          to overnight).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>step</b>
          <br />
          Remove flank steak from marinade and pat the meat dry with paper
          towels. Pour leftover marinade into a saucepan, place over medium
          heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes
          to make a basting sauce.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>step</b>
          <br />
          Grill flank steak for 2 1/2 minutes; turn meat around on grate to a
          45-degree angle to make diamond grill marks; grill for 2 1/2 more
          minutes. Repeat on second side, turning meat 45 degrees after 2 1/2
          minutes and grilling 2 1/2 more minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>step</b>
          <br />
          Flip steak to original side and paint meat with sauce. Continue to
          grill until sauce has glazed onto the meat, about 30 seconds. Turn
          meat over and brush other side with sauce. Sauce will burn if cooked
          too long. Repeat 1 more time, brushing and glazing sauce onto meat for
          about 30 seconds on each side. An instant-read meat thermometer,
          inserted into the thickest part of the flank steak, should read 125
          degrees F (52 degrees C).

          <br />
          Transfer steak to a platter and let rest 5 to 10 minutes before
          slicing lengthwise down the center; cut each half across the grain
          into slices about 3/8 inch thick. Drizzle slices with more sauce to
          serve.
